Naisu (奶酥) Filling
============================
Based on various Chinese food blogs and Google translate

Makes enough moderate filling for 8ish buns?

### Ingredients:
* 70g butter
* 30g powdered sugar
* 80g milk powder
* 1/8 tsp salt
* 30g beaten egg (save the rest for the egg & water wash on rolls)

### Directions:
* Cream together butter, powdered sugar, and salt
* Add egg (may take a while for egg to mix in to the creamed butter)
* Fold in milk powder and mix until just combined
* Weigh and roll into desired quantity
* Keep refrigerated until needed
* To use in a bread roll recipe, eg [this one](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/japanese-milk-bread-rolls-recipe): after shaping rolls, let them proof for 10-15 min. Then flatten and add a glob of filling, making sure to tightly pinch and seal the edges. Continue with second proof and baking instructions as directed.

### Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour (250g)
- 1 Tablespoon baking powder
- 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 6 Tablespoons unsalted butter very cold (85g)
- ¾ cup whole milk (177ml)

### Notes

To keep the butter cold, weigh it out, cut it into smaller chunks, and kept it in the freezer in a small bowl while preparing the dry ingredients.

### Directions

- Preheat to 450F (for skillet/dutch oven/cake pan), or 425F for baking tray
- Cut butter into cubes
- In a bowl, add flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder
- Whisk to combine
- Add butter to flour; can mix in with two forks (or pastry cutter?) until mixture resembles coarse crumbs/small pea size butter lumps
- Add cold milk, in three or four batches into the flour mixture. Using a fork, gently toss and stir together until large lumps form and all of the flour has been moistened
- Transfer the dough on to a lightly floured work surface
- Using hands, work dough together. 
- Once the dough is cohesive, fold in half over itself and use your hands to gently flatten layers together. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and fold in half again, repeating this step 5-6 times but taking care to not overwork the dough
- Use your hands (do not use a rolling pin) to flatten the dough to 1" thick and lightly dust a 2 ¾" round biscuit cutter with flour
- Making close cuts, press the biscuit cutter straight down into the dough and drop the biscuit onto your prepared baking sheet. Do NOT twist cutter or you'll damage the layers
- Place the cut biscuits into skillet/dutch oven/ cake pan. No need to grease containers
- Bake for ~18 minutes, or until golden brown on top. (If baking on flat tray, 425F for 16 min)

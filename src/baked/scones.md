"English style"

Calories: 
* 1992 without liquid
* 2540 with heavy whipping cream
* 2092 with whole milk

### Ingredients:

* All-purpose flour (280 g) (still too wet?)
* Baking powder (4 tsp) (16 g)
* Salt (1/2 tsp)
* Sugar (1/4 cup) (49.5 g)
* Unsalted butter (6 tbsp, room temperature)
* Egg (1 large)
* Milk/heavy whipping cream (2/3 cup) (160 g)

### Directions:

Preheat oven to 425F.

In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.

Chop up butter into small pieces. Add butter to dry ingredients and mix with your hands until the texture is sandy and has no more butter lumps.

In a bowl, whisk together milk and egg. Save 2 tbsp for the egg wash later. Pour rest of it into mixing bowl.

Stir to combine wet and dry ingredients until a rough dough forms, then use your hands to form them into a smooth lump of dough.

Place dough on a cutting surface and squash it to about an inch thick.

Cut into desired shapes (I did 16 small triangles).

Place onto baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush tops of scones with reserved egg wash. Bake for about 13-15 minutes until about tripled in height and golden brown on the tops and bottoms.

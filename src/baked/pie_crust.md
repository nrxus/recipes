### Ingredients:

* All-purpose flour (1 1/4 cups)
* Cold unsalted butter (1 stick, cut into 1/2 inch pieces)
* Salt (1/4 tsp)
* Ice water (3-5 tablespoons)

### Directions:

Blend together flour, butter, and salt in a large bowl with your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse meal with some roughly pea-size butter lumps.

Drizzle 3 tablespoons ice water evenly over mixture and gently stir with a fork (or pulse in processor) until incorporated.

If dough doesn't yet come together in a smooth lump, add more ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time. From past experience, 4 tablespoons does the trick. Do not add too much water. Do not overwork dough or pastry will be tough.

Once dough comes together into a smooth ball, squash it down in the bowl and knead it a few more times to help spread out the butter. Press into a 5 inch disk, then wrap in plastic wrap. Chill dough for as long as the recipe that needs the pie crust calls for.

Original recipe says: can be chilled up to 3 days

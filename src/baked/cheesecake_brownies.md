Cheesecake Brownies (WIP)
============================
Adapted from [Sugar Spun Run](https://sugarspunrun.com/cheesecake-brownies/)

### Ingredients:
#### Brownies:
* 12 Tablespoons unsalted butter cut into 12 pieces (170g) (1.5 sticks)
* 113g/4 oz semisweet chocolate chips
* 50g cocoa powder
* 100g granulated sugar
* 75g light brown sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 125g all-purpose flour

#### Cheesecake:
* 453g/16 oz full fat brick-style cream cheese, softened (2 bricks)
* 50g granulated sugar
* 65g full fat sour cream
* 2 large eggs
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Optional: powdered mixin (ie lucuma powder, matcha powder)

### Directions:
#### Brownies:
* Preheat your oven to 350F (175C). Line a 9Ã—9" baking pan with parchment paper (enough to overhang edges). Fold well so edges are pretty!
* Beat eggs, then mix in sugar to dissolve.
* Combine butter and chopped chocolate in a large, microwave safe bowl. Heat in 25-second intervals, stirring well in between, until both chocolate and butter are melted and mixture is smooth.
* Immediately add cocoa powder and instant coffee (if using) and stir until combined.
* Add egg/sugar mixture and vanilla extract and stir well.
* Sift salt and flour over the batter and stir until completely combined, but don't overmix.
* Spread batter evenly into prepared pan and bake for 13-15 minutes (the surface of the brownies should be beginning to set, but note that the brownies will not be cooked completely during this time!)
* Once finished, lower oven temp to 325F.
#### Cheesecake:
* While brownies are pre-baking, prepare cheesecake.
* Cream together cream cheese and sugar until completely smooth and well combined (scrape sides and bottom of bowl to make sure there are no lumps hiding).
* Stir in sour cream.
* Add eggs and vanilla extract and stir until combined.
* Set aside 1/4 of cheesecake filling in a separate bowl.
* Stir flavoring to taste into remaining 3/4 of filling (or do the reverse, depending on whether flavored or plain filling should dominate).
#### Assembly:
* Once brownie batter is out of the oven, carefully and evenly pour the 3/4 portion of cheesecake layer over the surface.
* Either dollop or pour in evenly spaced lines the 1/4 portion of cheesecake filling. Use an offset spatula or knife to swirl a pattern.
* Return to 325F oven and bake ~40-45 minutes or until cheesecake is set (center will still be jiggly if jostled). Edges may be slightly puffed or even slightly golden brown.
* Remove from oven and allow to cool at room temperature until no longer warm 1-2 hours). Transfer to refrigerator and chill 3-4 hours before slicing and serving.

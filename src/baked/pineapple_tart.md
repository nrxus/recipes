### Ingredients:

* 350g butter
* 100g condensed milk
* 550 g cake flour
* 2 egg yolks
* 2 ripe pineapples, cut into small pieces

### Directions:

Puree pineapples. Cook down into a paste until all moisture has evaporated. Set aside to cool slightly. When cool enough to touch, form into 20g balls and refrigerate while making the dough.

Cream butter and condensed milk till light using paddle attachment.

Add in egg yolk one at a time, and beat until combined.

Mix in flour until mixture becomes a soft and not sticky dough.

Form dough into 30g balls.

Roll each ball into a large enough circle to completely enclose the filling balls without having to stretch the dough. The dough is soft but not pliable, so it will crack when stretched. Make the edges of the circle thinner than the center, because they'll gather together when wrapping the tart.

After tart is wrapped into a ball, form into a square or rectangle shape.

Bake for 15 minutes 165째C/330째F. Carefully flip over the tarts. Bake for another 15 minutes.

Cool completely before storing.

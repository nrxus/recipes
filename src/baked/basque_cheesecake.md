Basque Cheesecake (WIP)
============================
Adapted from [Tasty Co](https://tasty.co/recipe/classic-basque-cheesecake)

### Ingredients:
* 2 lb cream cheese, softened (4 packs)
* 1.25 cups granulated sugar (250g)
* 5 large eggs, room temperature
* Did not use: 2 egg yolks
* 2 cups heavy cream, room temperature
* 3teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 0.25 cup all purpose flour

### Directions:
* Preheat oven to 400F.
* In mixer bowl, cream together the cream cheese and sugar on medium speed until the sugar completely dissolves, about 5 minutes. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
* Add the eggs, 1 at a time, mixing between each addition until fully incorporated. Add the egg yolks and beat to incorporate. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. The batter should be very smooth and homogenous.
* Slowly pour in the cream and mix until incorporated. Add the vanilla and salt and mix just to combine.
* Use a fine-mesh sieve to sift in the flour, then mix until just incorporated.
* Crumple 2 sheets of parchment paper, then unwrap and press into a 9-inch springform pan, stacking the top sheet perpendicular to the bottom sheet so the entire pan is covered. Make sure some excess sticks up from the sides as the cheesecake will rise quite a bit. Pour the batter into the pan and smooth the top. Place on a baking sheet.
* Bake the cheesecake until the top is a dark golden brown and the cake is slightly jiggly in the center, 50â€“60 minutes. If the top doesn't seem brown enough when otherwise ready, broil for 30 sec - 1 min (be careful and check often as it burns fast).
* Cooling suggestions:
    * Let cool at room temperature for 2 hours, then remove the springform and gently unwrap the parchment from the sides of the cheesecake. Cheescake can also be refrigerated covered for a few days.
    * Let cool at room temperature , then refrigerate uncovered for 5 hours or 2 days

### Ingredients

* Chicken (2.5 boneless)
* Eggs (2 units)
* All Purpose Flour
* Corn Starch
* Vegetable Oil
* Oyster Sauce (5 tbs)
* Soy Sauce (1 tbsp)
* Sesame Oil (1 tbsp)
* Minced/Crushed Garlic (2-3 tsp)
* Ginger
* Curry Leaves
* Bird Eye Chillies (10 units)
* Butter (100 g)
* Evaporated Milk (2 Cups) OR Fresh Milk (4.5 cups)

* Shaoxing Cooking Wine (3 tbsp)

### Procedure

Mix:

* 3 tbsp of oyster sauce
* Soy sauce
* Sesame Oil
* Salt
* Pepper

Cut chicken into cubes and let it marinade in the mixture above for 20 minutes.

Beat eggs and add them onto the mixture.

Mix flour and corn starch in a 3:2 ratio. Coat each chicken cube in the flour + corn starch mix.

Deep fry the chicken in hot oil.

Chop the chillies into small bits.

Melt butter in a work or frying pan. Stir fry the garlic and ginger in the butter.
Add the curry leaves, followed by the diced chillies. Continue stir frying until you can smell the aroma of the curry leaves.

Add the milk and water into the wok, moving it often to make sure no ingredient is stuck in the bottom or burnt. Add  the remaining of the oyster sace, the cooking wine, and salt to taste.

Cook until the buttery cream has thickened. Turn off heat and add in the chicken. Toss such that the fried schicken is coated by the buttery cream.

Traditionally served with rice but split peas are a good lower calorie alternative.

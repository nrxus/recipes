## Filling

If there is any juice from the vegetables when you chop/shred them, don’t add the juice into the meat mixture. The filling is juicy enough without it.

### If making ahead of time
#### A,B,C, and dumplings containing juice like 小籠包
If making ahead of time:
Mix ground meat with seasonings. Add water little by little while stirring. Stop when the meat can't absorb any more water. Keep the meat in the fridge overnight. Add vegetables before making dumplings.

#### D, E
Add vegetables right before you are going to make dumplings. This can prevent the filling from becoming watery.

### If making ahead of time
#### A,B,C, and dumplings containing juice like 小籠包
If making ahead of timeMix ground meat with seasonings. Add water little by little while stirring. Stop when the meat can't absorb any more water. Keep the meat in the fridge overnight. Add vegetables before making dumplings.

#### D, E
Add vegetables right before you are going to make dumplings. This can prevent the filling from becoming watery.

## Cooking directions
### Fresh dumplings
Boil water, then put in dumplings. Don't overcrowd the pot.

Turn heat down so water is at a simmer. Cook dumlpings until they float, about 5 minutes. Wait for another minute or so, then immediately remove with a slotted spoon. Overcooked dumplings will fall apart

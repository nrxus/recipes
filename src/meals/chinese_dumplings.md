## Filling

**NOTE**
If there is any juice from the vegetables when you chop/shred them, don’t add the juice into the meat mixture. The filling is juicy enough without it.

### Common ingredients
* Salt
* Soy sauce
* Sesame oil
* Cooking wine (optional)
* Fresh prawns (optional), chopped (add one piece to each dumpling)

### A
* Ground pork (equal portion by volume to chives) (no beef, apparently gives you indigestion when mixed with chives?)
* Chinese chives, chopped
* Salt
* Soy sauce
* Sesame oil

### B
* Ground pork/ beef
* Cabbage, chopped (squeeze juice out before adding to meat)
* Green onion, chopped
* Shittake mushrooms, soaked in hot water (squeeze out water) (chopping optional)
* Dried shrimp

### C

### D

### If making ahead of time
#### A,B,C, and dumplings containing juice like 小籠包
If making ahead of time:
Mix ground meat with seasonings. Add water little by little while stirring. Stop when the meat can't absorb any more water. Keep the meat in the fridge overnight. Add vegetables before making dumplings.

#### D, E
Add vegetables right before you are going to make dumplings. This can prevent the filling from becoming watery.

## Tips

* Make sure to seal dumplings very tightly
* Don't trap air in the dumpling, or they'll float too soon
* Don't overcook dumplings, or the skin will fall apart

## Cooking directions
### Fresh dumplings

Boil water on high heat.

Once water is at a rolling boil, put dumplings in pot.

Once water is back to a rolling boil, turn down the heat to medium/medium high and keep water at a rolling boil until dumplings are floating (dumplings may float too soon if they weren't made properly, so eyeball it).

Add ~1 cup of cold water and keep on high heat. Wait for water to get to a rolling boil again and dumplings are floating. Turn off the heat immediately.

### Frozen dumplings

Boil water on high heat.

Once water is at a rolling boil, put dumplings in pot.

Once water is back to a rolling boil, turn down the heat to medium/medium high and keep water at a rolling boil until dumplings are floating (dumplings may float too soon if they weren't made properly, so eyeball it).

Add ~1 cup of cold water and keep on high heat. Wait for water to get to a rolling boil again and dumplings are floating. 

Add another cup of cold water.  Wait for water to get to a rolling boil again, then turn off the heat immediately.

CHICKEN CHILI (7 Servings)
============================
[Ají de Gallina](./meals/aji_de_gallina.html)

### Ingredients:

* Bread (1-2 rolls)
* Chicken (2.5 boneless OR 4.5 lbs bone-in)
* Minced/Crushed Garlic (2-3 tsp)
* Peruvian Yellow Pepper (3 tbsp)
* Turmeric
* Milk
* Parmesan Cheese
* Potatoes (7 medium-sized)
* Vegetable Oil

#### Optional:

* Rice (2.5 cups)
* Eggs (4 units)

### Procedure:

The following could be done in parallel:

* Boil the potatoes with a bit of salt
* Boil the chicken with a bit of salt
* Boil the eggs
* Cook the rice

After the chicken is done (tender), pull it. Save the water in which the chicken was cooked for later.
If the chicken is boneless, it is effective to use two forks to help pull the chicken.

In a frying pan, add a bit of oil and start heating it at mid temperature.
While it's heating, lightly fry the garlic until golden, stirring often.
Once the garlic is ready, start frying the yellow pepper on top.
When the pepper and the garlic are properly sautéed, add the tumeric to taste and the water from the chicken from earlier.
Pay attention to the color to determine when it's enough.
Continue stirring and add the bread for consistency. Once the bread is well integrated with the mixture (no obvious lumps), add a bit of milk to taste.

At this step you may add some of the parmesan cheese into the mixture, or wait to add it on top of the meal later as a garnish.

Let the mixture cook while stirring every so often until the desired consistency is achieved. 

It is served in a plate with sliced potatoes served under the spicy cream. You may optionally add rice and/or a boiled egg to the side.
